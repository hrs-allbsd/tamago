Tamago 4.0.6.0.20041122.19.14

Hiroki Sato <hrs@allbsd.org>

This package is a variant of Tamago, CJK input method (frontend) for
Emacsen.  Tamago had been developed by the respective authors and then
the development has been stalled since around 2004.  However, changes in
the latest Emacen often prevented it from working.

To maintain it in a good shape, this package imports fixes and
improvements.  It is based on 4.0.6, and patches from Debian package,
egg_4.0.6+0.20041122cvs-19.diff are applied.  Further changes are
recorded in ChangeLog.

While most of the fixes and improvements should be portable,
the author (of this document) has tested them primarily on
FreeBSD/amd64.  Please report if there is something wrong.
